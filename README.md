scripts to build PageSpeed Optimization Libraries with Docker

Please see https://github.com/apache/incubator-pagespeed-ngx/issues/1760#issuecomment-1358070522

This project is part of https://deb.myguard.nl/nginx-modules/

Please note, PAGESPEED is ABANDONED. I don't recommend to implement it if you are not using it already. There are other alternatives. The goal of this project is to keep pagespeed working as long as possible for on modern software, but there will be an end to this effort sometime.

Pull requests are welcome.
